# PLAYING-WITH-CSS-VARIABLES-JS
#
#
# This project is to help me learn variables with css as well as more practice with javascript and html.
# 
#
#
# For my html setup I went real simple with a h1, a div for the controls, as well as labels and inputs. I found one of the vehicle details that I have done over the years, and used that as the picture.
#
#
# For the css I created variables in the root CSS selector and applied each variable to a specific property of the img
#
#
# For starters in the JavaScript I wanted to grab every input in the controls class and store them into a variable
#
#
# Next I wanted to create a function that changed the CSS properties. I learned about dataset and setting the sizing in html to px in the suffix variable. I had to add or nothing because the value of the base variable would not account for the color hexadecimal value.
#
#
# I then set the property of each input with the value + the px so it would change in the dom.
#
#
# Lastly two event listeners to listen for a change in the inputs and a mouse move for the color that then changed each input to what the user picked.
